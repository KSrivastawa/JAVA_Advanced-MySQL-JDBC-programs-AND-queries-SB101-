Q3) What is exception handling in java, Write the hierarchy of Exception class and, Mention some
	of the predefined Exception classes at least 5, and the reason when those exception class
	object is generated in our application.

Ans:

	Exception Handling in Java
	--------------------------
	
	> The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that the 
	normal flow of the application can be maintained.

	Hierarchy of Java Exception classes
	-----------------------------------
	-The java.lang.Throwable class is the root class of Java Exception hierarchy inherited by two 
	subclasses: Exception and Error. The hierarchy of Java Exception classes is given below:

						  Object
			    			|
		                Throwable
                            |
           ----------------------------------
           |					            |
       Exception 				       	 Error
            |
     RuntimeException


	-> Predefined Exception classes:
	
	1. InputMismatchException
	reason:- If we divide any number by zero, there occurs an ArithmeticException.
	
	2. ArithmeticException
	reason:- If we have a null value in any variable, performing any operation on the 
			 variable throws a NullPointerException.
			
	3. NullPointerException
	reason:- Thrown when an application attempts to use null in a case where an object is required.
		 These include: 
			•Calling the instance method of a null object. 
			•Accessing or modifying the field of a null object. 
			•Taking the length of null as if it were an array. 
			•Accessing or modifying the slots of null as if it were an array. 
			•Throwing null as if it were a Throwable value. 
	
	
	4. NumberFormatException
	reason:- If the formatting of any variable or number is mismatched, it may result into NumberFormatException.
	 Suppose we have a string variable that has characters; converting this variable into digit will
	  cause NumberFormatException.
	  
	5. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
	reason:- When an array exceeds to it's size, the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs. there may be other
			 reasons to occur ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
