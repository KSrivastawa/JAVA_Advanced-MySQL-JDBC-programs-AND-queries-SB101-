Question 1: Explain difference between PriorityQueue() and LinkedList().

Ans:
	-> A LinkedList with one element does the same thing as a PriorityQueue with one element.
	 
	-> LinkedList preserves the insertion order, PriorityQueue does not.
	
	-> PriortiyQueue as well as Linkedlist implement the Queue Interface and perform operations same 
	the way as a Queue (FIFO).
	
	-> The difference between PriorityQueue and Linkedlist is at the time of insertion PriorityQueue
	 will be sorted as well as ordered as per the natural order but we can add a Commparator also in order 
	 to define the particular order of sorting for a record, while as LinkedList will be just ordered. So 
	 while you are trying to add elements in PriorityQueue, they will get sorted on the basis of their natural
	  order or as per the comparator function. 

	 for Example: 
	 
	 import java.util.LinkedList;
	import java.util.PriorityQueue;
	import java.util.Queue;
	
	public class QueueInJava {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>(); 
	    queue.add("Ishfaq");
	    queue.add("Ramzan");
	    queue.add("Nagoo");
	    queue.add("Bangalore");
	    
	    System.out.println("Linked List Queue is:" + queue);
	    System.out.println("Linked List Queue Peek is :" + queue.peek());
	    
	    queue.poll();
	    System.out.println("Linked List Queue after remove is:" + queue);
	    
	    
	    Queue<Integer> queuenew = new PriorityQueue<>();
	    
	    
	    queuenew.add(2);
	    queuenew.add(3);
	    queuenew.add(1);
	    queuenew.add(0);
	    queuenew.add(4);
	    
	    System.out.println("Priority Queue is:" + queuenew);
	    System.out.println("Priority Queue Peek is :" + queuenew.peek());
	    
	    int ieleFirst=queuenew.remove();
	    System.out.println("Priority Queue Element Removed is:" + ieleFirst);
	    int ieleSecond=queuenew.remove();
	    System.out.println("Priority Queue Element Removed is:" + ieleSecond);
	    System.out.println("Priority Queue after remove is:" + queuenew);
	  }
	
	}

Output:

	Linked List Queue is: [Ishfaq, Ramzan, Nagoo, Bangalore]
	
	Linked List Queue Peek is: Ishfaq
	
	Linked List Queue after remove() is: [Ramzan, Nagoo, Bangalore]
	
	Priority Queue is: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
	
	Priority Queue Peek is: 0
	
	Priority Queue Element Removed is: 0
	
	Priority Queue Element Removed is: 1
	
	Priority Queue after remove() is: [2, 3, 4]
