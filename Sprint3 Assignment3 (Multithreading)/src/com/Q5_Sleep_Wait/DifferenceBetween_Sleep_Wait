Q5/- What is the difference between the sleep and wait method?

Ans:

	Sleep(): 
	-------
	- This Method is used to pause the execution of current thread for a specified time in Milliseconds. 
	 Here, Thread does not lose its ownership of the monitor and resume’s it’s execution
	 
	 - Sleep() is a static method. 
	 
	 - There is no need to call sleep() from Synchronized context (can be or cannot be).
	 
    
    Wait():
	------
	-  This method is defined in object class. It tells the calling thread (a.k.a Current Thread) to wait 
	 until another thread invoke’s the notify() or notifyAll() method for this object, The thread waits until
	 it re-obtains the ownership of the monitor and Resume’s Execution.
	 
	 - Wait() is not a static method. 
	 
	 - Wait() should be called only from Synchronized context.
	 
	 
	 Example:
	 
		synchronized(monitor){
		    while(condition == true)
		    {
		        monitor.wait()  //releases monitor lock
		    }
		 
		    Thread.sleep(100); //puts current thread on Sleep   
		}
