Q5) Differentiate between the Thread class and Runnable interface for creating a
 Thread?

Ans: 

	=> Thread class and Runnable interface are the two structures using which we implement Thread based
       multitasking in java.

	Thread Class:
	-------------
			- There is a class by the name Thread present in java.lang package, which has a method called start(),
			  this start() method is used to execute a given functionality defined inside the run() method of Runnable
			  interface as a separate thread.
	
	
	Runnable Interface:
	------------------
			- The signature of a function using which we implement a thread is defined in an interface by the name
			  Runnable. This Runnable interface belongs to java.lang package. it has only one
			  abstract method:  public void run();
			
	* Note: Internally the Thread class implements the Runnable interface and override run() method with empty
            implementation.
			
	For Example:
	- - - - - -
		
		   class Task implements Runnable{
		  
				@Override
				public void run (){
					System.out.println ("Runnable interface");
				}
			}
			
			class ThreadDemo extends Thread{
				@Override
				public void run(){
					System.out.println( "Thread class ");
				}
			}
			
			class RunnableDemo {
				public static void main (String ... args){
			new ThreadDemo().start();
				
					new Thread (new Task(), "Thread 1").start();
					
					new Thread (new Task(), "Thread 2").start();
				}
			}


	Output for this code will be like this:
	--------------------------------------
	Thread class
	Runnable interface
	Runnable interface
