Q: What is thread priority?

Answer: 
	
	- In Java it is possible to assign the priority of thread. 
		- To Set these priority java thread class has provided two predefined methods.
		1. setPriority  2. getPriority
		
	- The thread class has also provided three pre-defined final static variable and its value lie between 1 to 10.
			
			Thread.MIN_PRIORITY ---> 1
			Thread.NORM_PRIORITY ---> 5   // by default priority set by JVM.
			Thread.MAX_PRIORITY ---> 10
			
		Example:
		--------
			 class A {
			 	p.s.v.m(String[] args){
			 		
			 		A t1 = new A();  // set 5
			 		A t1 = new A();  // set 10
			 		A t1 = new A();  // 1
			 	
			 	}
			 }
			 
			* If we are not setting priority then JVM will their priority that is by default.
