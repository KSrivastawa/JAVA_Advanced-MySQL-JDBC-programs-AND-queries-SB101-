Q: What is Synchronization?

Answer: 

	Synchronization:
	----------------
		- It is a technique through which we can control multiple threads or among the number of threads only
		  one thread will enter inside the synchronized area. 

	*Note:-
	       The main purpose of Synchronization is to overcome when multiple threads are trying to access same resource
	        at same time on that situation it may provides some wrong result.
	        
	      => Synchronization is broadly classified into 2 categories:
	      1. method level Synchronization
	      2. block level Synchronization
	      
	 Method level:
	 ------------
	 	
	 	public void run(){
	 	
	 		// same resource
	    
	    }
	    
	    t1.start();  t2.start();  t3.start(); 
	    - all 3 will run at same time then it will possible to give wrong output, to avoid this disturbance we use
	      synchronized method.
	      
	    solution:
	    - - - - - 
	    	public synchronized void run() {
	    		
	    			// same resource
	    			
	    	 }
	  		
	  		  t1.start();  t2.start();  t3.start(); 
	  		  - here if t1.start() is running then rest no one can enter inside the method, all have to wait.
	  		   	 
	   block level:
	   ------------
	   *advantage: "save time";
	   
	   		public void hotel(){
	   		
	   			synchronized(this){
	   			  
	   			    // same response
	   			  
	   			 }
	  		
	  		}
	  		
	  	  t1.start();  t2.start();  t3.start(); 
	  
	    	 - here in this case all 3 object will comes inside the hotel method at a time and then from there it
	    	   decided that which is called first, that will run first rest will wait once it complete their process
	    	   then next will run accordingly.
